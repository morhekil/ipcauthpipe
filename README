This is implementation of Courier's authpipe protocol over Invision Power Board
and Converge.

This gem acts as an interface between Courier's authlib with Invision's members
database and allows to authenticate with authlib against Invision's DB.

To run it you have to take sample config file included in the gem sources and
modify it to match your environment. Then configure your courier-authlib
to run ipcauthpipe with full path to your config file as a parameter, i.e.:
/usr/local/ipcauthpipe /etc/ipcauthpipe-config.yml
